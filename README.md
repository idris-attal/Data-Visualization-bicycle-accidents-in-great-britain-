### Programming for Data Science   |   Mohammad Idris Attal

In this project I will use the dataset regarding the Bicycle Accidents in Great Britain (1979 to 2018). This Dataset contains data such as the accident_index, number_of_vehicles_involved, number_of_casualties, date and time of accident, speed_limit, road_and_weather_conditions, day of the accident and finally the road_type in which the accident took place.


With the help of provided dataset we can analyze different aspects such as analyzation based on number of casualties, number of vehicles, road conditions, speed limit and so on. In this project, the intention was to analyze the number of casualties for each year. In the of phase of Machine Learning and model evaluation, Linear and Polynominal regression along with Random Forest algorithms are applied to predict number of causalities for future years based on the total number of causalities per year. The intention of appliction of different models was to get the best optimal solution possible.
